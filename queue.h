/**
 * Queues, in Forkscan, are circular buffers that are thread-safe,
 * linearizable data structures, assuming single-reader, single-writer
 * usage.  A queue is initialized given the struct and a buffer that will
 * be used to store the values.
 *
 * Note: Unfortunately, C doesn't support templates, and "faking it" with
 * macros is ugly and hard to debug.  So if a type other than size_t is
 * ever needed, some code duplication will have to happen.
